The emotion-based song recommendation system utilizes face recognition technology to identify users' expression and enhance user experience by suggesting music that aligns with their emotional state in real-time. By analyzing facial expressions, the system identifies the user's mood and offers suitable music to help them feel happier, calmer, or more energized. This personalized approach not only improves customer satisfaction but also promotes emotional wellness by providing a therapeutic and enjoyable music experience. This project ensures an engaging listening experience that can positively impact mental health and overall well-being.
